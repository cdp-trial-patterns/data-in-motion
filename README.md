# CDP Public Cloud - Data Distribution with Cloudera DataFlow Trial - Instructions

## Multiple Use Cases can be tested using this Trial

This trial allows you to see how Cloudera DataFlow can be used to implement several different use cases such as:

1. [Filtering and processing streaming data](01_kafka_filter_kafka.md)
2. [Transforming and ingesting streaming data into an open data lakehouse powered by Apache Iceberg](02_kafka_iceberg.md)
3. [Building and deploying a serverless function that provides an API to resize images](03_resize_image.md)

Throughout this trial you will be using the ReadyFlow Gallery to look for templates to get started with, the DataFlow Designer to customize, configure and test your data flows and the Deployment Wizard to create auto-scaling, production grade flow deployments which can be monitored in the central dashboard.

Let’s get started with [Use Case 1: Filtering and processing streaming data](01_kafka_filter_kafka.md).

If you prefer following a video, you’ll find a narrated walkthrough of all three trial use cases on the [Cloudera YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqaT7FDd0Fc).
